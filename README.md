# Browser game - SpaceSabres
Browser game made using php, html, css and vanilla javascript. My first big project - reflected on the poor code quality.

# Setup
First, clone the project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DewEnforcer/Spacesabres.git
```
Afterwards, place all files into your server folder, create database called "spacesabres" in your mysql database and import the db.sql file.
